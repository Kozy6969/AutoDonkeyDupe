# simple auto dupe mod for 8b8t.me 

how to use:

on an account use Donkey to auto open the donkey inv, inventory tweaks to grab the items and meteor plus "auto drop plus" to drop them

on the second account use Ride Donkey and Auto login (from meteor rejects). In auto login put ".dismount" as the command thats supposed to run when you join 8b8t

the delays on each module are different depending on ur hardware, ping and other factors so just try to find the perfect delay for every module

# how to recompile

open the folder in command prompt and type "./gradlew build"


if you want to change the version that it recompiles to then go to gradle.properties and change the minecraft version, yarn mappins and meteor version to the version that you want.
