# simple auto dupe mod for 8b8t.me 

how to use:

on an account use Donkey to auto open the donkey inv, inventory tweaks to grab the items and "auto drup" to drop them

on the second account use Ride Donkey, Auto Disconnect (disconectingfromthegame), Auto Reconnect (i recommand setting the reconnect delay to 0.1 but you can do whatever) and Auto login (from meteor rejects). In auto login put ".dismount" as the command thats supposed to run when you join 8b8t

the delays on each module are different depending on ur hardware, ping and other factors so just try to find the perfect delay for every module
